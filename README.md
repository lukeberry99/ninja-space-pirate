#ninja-space-pirate
==================

My first attempt at any sort of game in Java.

Welcome to Ninja Space Pirate.  The basis of the game is simple.  You’re a Ninja.  They’re Pirates.  Kill them.  Oh, and you’re in space, and in space ships... Naturally.

The graphics currently aren’t at a stage where you resemble a Ninja, or they resemble Pirates, but they’ll get there eventually.

## How to Install

* Clone the repo
* Compile SpaceGame.java from the command line
```
$ javac SpaceGame.java
```
## Todo
- [ ] Fix bullet collision
- [ ] Add a health system
- [ ] Make the enemies fire back
- [ ] Animations
- [ ] Better graphics
- [ ] Menu system
- [x] Game is restartable
