![SpaceGame](http://localhostr.com/file/930/tq6Md6HRxZL8/Screen-Shot-2013-04-05-at-01.44.35.png) 

My first attempt at any sort of game in Java.

Welcome to Ninja Space Pirate.  The basis of the game is simple.  You’re a Ninja.  They’re Pirates.  Kill them.  Oh, and you’re in space, and in space ships... Naturally.

The graphics currently aren’t at a stage where you resemble a Ninja, or they resemble Pirates, but they’ll get there eventually.

## How to install

You can either compile from the source using the instructions below, or download the latest stable jar from the files page.

Clone the repo using  
```
$ git clone https://github.com/Exoflux/ninja-space-pirate.git
```
Move into the src folder and compile *SpaceGame.java*  
```
$ cd ninja-space-pirate/src
$ javac SpaceGame.java
```
You shouldn't encounter any problems.

## Todo
- ~~Fix bullet collision~~
- Add a health system
- Make the enemies fire back
- Animations
- Better graphics
- Menu system
- ~~Game is restartable~~
